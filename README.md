# Identifying wind turbines from multiresolution and multibackground remote sensing imagery
Cloning codes and downloading the weights in https://github.com/zyyyccc/WT-YOLO/releases/tag/weights

Run `train.py` / `val.py` / `detect.py` to train a new model / validate the trained model / detect test images on example_dataset. The results would be saved to `runs/train` / `runs/val` / `runs/detect`
